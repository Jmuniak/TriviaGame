This was the first project I used an AJAX request in.
Everything takes place without the broswer refreshing. 

Clicking the "start button" hides the button and makes an AJAX request to populate questions and answers.

It incorporates a basic count down timer and tracks the users correct answer score as they proceed through the question set. This is displayed at the end so as not to distract the user, allowing them to focus on the task at hand. If they fail to answer in time it will not give them credit for a correct answer and moves along without inturuption.
